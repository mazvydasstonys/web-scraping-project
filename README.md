# Web Scraping Projects (Python)

This repository contains my Python web scraping practice projects created while learning Python.  
The goal of these projects was to work with real-world websites, extract useful data, and store it in a structured format.

## Projects

- Extract key vehicle information from listing pages  
- Retrieve VIN codes from listings (including hidden VIN data)  
- Clean and structure the collected data  
- Store results in SQLite for further analysis  

**Tools:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Pandas, SQLite
